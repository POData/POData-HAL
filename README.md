POData-HAL
==========

[HAL+JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-06) Response Writers for POData 


Why?
==========
HAL+JSON is a Hypermedia format with a very discoverable interface.  Presenting an OData API in HAL+JSON is an interesting enough experiement that also causes the [POData](https://github.com/POData/POData) library to be more robust for other format writers.
